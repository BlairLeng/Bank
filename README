General Information:
	In this project, we have account system, loan system, login system, transaction
	system, stock system and central system. Each system has its own functionalities.
	For example, account system is dealing with all the operations with accounts.
	In each system package, we will have a xxxSystem file, a xxxSystemFunctions
	file and a xxxSystemSQL file. For each xxxSystem file, it is dealing with all
	the logical operations and logics. For each xxxSystemFunctions file, this is an
	interface file which defines the functions in the project description. For each
	xxxSystemSQL file, it is dealing with all the mySQL queries. Each main page in
	gui package will link to a xxxSystem.java file and will be easy to check what
	it can call from xxxSystemFunctions.java.
